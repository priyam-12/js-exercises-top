# Exercise 01 - Hello World
A function that prints "Hello world!"
<br>
# Exercise 02 - repeatString

Write a function that simply repeats the string a given number of times:

```javascript
repeatString('hey', 3) // returns 'heyheyhey'
```

This function will take two arguments, `string` and `num`.
<br>
# Exercise 03 - Reverse a String

Pretty simple, write a function called `reverseString` that returns its input, reversed!

```javascript
reverseString('hello there') // returns 'ereht olleh'
```

### Hints
Strings in JavaScript cannot be reversed directly so you're going to have to split it into something else first.. do the reversal and then join it back together into a string.
